                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin. <br><br>                ☛ His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very religious mindset.<br><br> ☛ From 1956 to 1959, Khan was employed by the Karachi Metropolitan
                Corporation (city government) as an Inspector of weights and measures, and applied for a scholarship that allowed him to study in West Germany<br><br> ☛ In 1962, while on vacation in The Hague, he met Hendrina "Henny" Reternik a British
                passport holder who had been born in South Africa to Dutch expatriates. She spoke Dutch and had spent her childhood in Africa before returning with her parents to the Netherlands where she lived as a registered foreigner.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1967, Khan obtained an engineer's degree in materials technology an equivalent to a Master of Science (MS) offered in English-speaking nations such as Pakistan and joined the doctoral program in metallurgical engineering
                at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium.<strong>
                        “ metallurgical engineering”</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ In 1972, Khan joined the Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory (or in Dutch: FDO), an engineering firm subsidiary of Verenigde Machinefabrieken (VMF) based in Amsterdam, from Brabers's recommendation.
                <br><br> ☛ he FDO was a subcontractor for Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland of the, British-German-Dutch uranium enrichment consortium, URENCO which was operating a uranium enrichment plant in Almelo and employed gaseous centrifuge method to
                assure a supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in the Netherlands.
                <br><br> ☛ Frits Veerman, Khan's colleague at FDO, uncovered nuclear espionage at Almelo where Khan had stolen designs of the centrifuges from URENCO for the nuclear weapons programme of Pakistan.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1975, Khan was transferred to a less sensitive section when URENCO became suspicious and he subsequently returned to Pakistan with his wife and two daughters. Khan was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in 1983
                by the Netherlands for espionage but the conviction was later overturned due to a legal technicality.
                <br><br> ☛ This was also highlighted when despite Archie Pervez (Khan's associate for nuclear procurement in the US) being convicted in 1988, no action was taken against Khan or his proliferation network by the US government which needed
                the support of Pakistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.
                <br><br> ☛ Upon learning of India's surprise nuclear test <b>7</b> 'Smiling Buddha' in May 1974 <b>40</b> Khan wanted to contribute to efforts to build an atomic bomb and met with officials at the Pakistani Embassy in<b>The Hague</b> who
                dissuaded him by saying it was "hard to find" a job in PAEC as a "metallurgist"<b>Padma Vibhushan
                        in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
                <br><br> ☛ In August 1974, Khan wrote a letter which went unnoticed, but he directed another letter through the Pakistani ambassador to the Prime Minister's Secretariat in September 1974.
                <br><br> ☛ 0 January 1972 that was being directed by Munir Ahmad Khan, a reactor physicist, which calls into question of his "father-of" claim.After reading his letter, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had his military secretary run
                a security check on Khan, who was unknown at that time, for verification and asked PAEC to dispatch a team under Bashiruddin Mahmood that met Khan at his family home in Almelo and directed Bhutto's letter to meet him in Islamabad.
                <br><br> ☛ In August 2021, Khan was admitted to Khan Research Laboratories Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19.Khan died on
